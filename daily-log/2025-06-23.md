**Commit:** `ðŸ”§ Updated streak log and refined repo structure`  

**Summary:**  
Started the new week with purpose by updating my daily log and reviewing the structure of one of my GitHub repositories. Tidied up files, improved readability, and took a moment to reflect on the power of quiet consistency.

**Reflection:**  
Mondays are fresh chapters. I didnâ€™t build a massive feature today, but I honored the process â€” and that matters. Every thoughtful touch, every logged thought, becomes part of something greater. Streaks arenâ€™t just proof of work; theyâ€™re proof of *intention*.
