# Daily Log – June 07, 2025

✨ ** Streak – We keep rising!**

Today wasn’t just about making a commit — it was about showing up, staying consistent, and proving to myself that even when life gets chaotic, I can *still choose* growth, even in small doses.

## 💭 Reflections
There’s something powerful about repetition. This streak is more than just green squares. It’s:
- A reminder that effort compounds.
- A promise to my future self.
- A quiet rebellion against burnout.

## 🔍 What I’ve Been Thinking About
Lately, I’ve been juggling multiple roles: developer, designer, writer, and learner. It’s easy to feel scattered, but today I took a moment to breathe and reframe. Every role I play feeds into the bigger vision I have for myself.

I’m not just building apps or writing code — I’m building *my story*.

## 📌 Goals for June
- Finish pending sections on the **Phisher** deployment
- Improve the visual style of **Timo’s Breadwinner**
- Write and publish one blog post on something I'm learning
- Write a story!
- Set aside time for gesture drawing and animation practice

## 🧠 Reminder to Self
> "You don’t have to move fast. You just have to keep moving."

That’s what this streak is teaching me. Forward is forward.
